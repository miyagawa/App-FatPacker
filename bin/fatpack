=head1 NAME

fatpack - Command line frontend for App::FatPacker

=head1 COMMANDS

=head2 trace

  $ fatpack trace [--to=trace-file|--to-stderr] myscript.pl

Compiles myscript.pl (as in "perl -c") and writes out a trace file containing
every module require()d during the compilation.

The trace file is called 'fatpacker.trace' by default; the --to option
overrides this.

If you pass --to-stderr fatpack writes the trace to STDERR instead.

You cannot pass both --to and --to-stderr.

=head2 packlists-for

  $ fatpack packlists-for Module1 Module2 Module3

Searches your perl's @INC for .packlist files containing the .pm files for
the modules requested and emits a list of unique packlist files to STDOUT.

These packlists will, in a pure cpan-installation environment, be all non-core
distributions required for those modules.

Unfortunately most vendors strip the .packlist files so if you installed
modules via e.g. apt-get you may be missing those modules; installing your
dependencies into a L<local::lib|local::lib> first is the preferred workaround.

=head2 tree

  $ fatpack tree fatlib packlist1 packlist2 packlist3

Takes a list of packlist files and copies their contents into a tree at the
requested location.

This tree should be sufficient to 'use lib' to make available all modules
provided by the distributions whose packlists were specified.

=head2 file

  $ fatpack file

Recurses into the 'lib' and 'fatlib' directories and bundles all .pm files
found into a BEGIN block which adds a virtual @INC entry to load these files
from the bundled code rather than disk.

=head1 RECIPES

Current basic recipe for packing:

  $ fatpack trace myscript.pl
  $ fatpack packlists-for `cat fatpacker.trace` >packlists
  $ fatpack tree `cat packlists`
  $ (fatpack file; cat myscript.pl) >myscript.packed.pl
